# Discord Bot in Python

This is my (like the title says) Custom Discord Bot written in Python.

# Setup

Just create a file called "token.txt" and enter the Discord Token.
I don't really remember exactly how to setup Discord OAUTH that stuff.
So, don't call me lazy, but, search it on Google.
